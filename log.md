# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 14, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Completed two Interview Prep challenges on HackerRank. 

**Thoughts**: I learned about Bubble Sort, which seemed pretty inefficient for long arrays. I also learned about using Array.sort() with a compare function to properly sort arrays of numbers in ascending order. I look forward to learning more about Algorithms.

### Day 2: December 15, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Basic Data Structures lesson on freeCodeCamp. 

**Thoughts**: This was a refresher to prepare me for the algorithm sections, but I also learned more about some object and array methods that I knew about but had not practiced. These will come in handy in the future!

### Day 3: December 16, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Completed half of the Basic Algorithm Scripting lesson on freeCodeCamp. 

**Thoughts**: It was tough getting to the computer today after a busy morning and a headache but I was able to make some progress today, thanks to my devotion to this challenge. I was hoping this lesson would show me the most efficient ways to solve the challenges, but it ended up being just more practice for me. I will try to read more detailed articles on the subject in the future.

### Day 4: December 17, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Basic Algorithm Scripting lesson on freeCodeCamp. 

**Thoughts**: I learned about primitive values and how they are immutable. I also discovered that while practicing these challenges, sometimes it feels like I am not learning anything new. But they are helping me get better and faster at recognizing the subtle differences between all of the array and string methods, when to use them, and how to use them properly.
