# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 14, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Completed two Interview Prep challenges on HackerRank. 

**Thoughts**: I learned about Bubble Sort, which seemed pretty inefficient for long arrays. I also learned about using Array.sort() with a compare function to properly sort arrays of numbers in ascending order. I look forward to learning more about Algorithms.

### Day 2: December 15, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Basic Data Structures lesson on freeCodeCamp. 

**Thoughts**: This was a refresher to prepare me for the algorithm sections, but I also learned more about some object and array methods that I knew about but had not practiced. These will come in handy in the future!

### Day 3: December 16, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Completed half of the Basic Algorithm Scripting lesson on freeCodeCamp. 

**Thoughts**: It was tough getting to the computer today after a busy morning and a headache but I was able to make some progress today, thanks to my devotion to this challenge. I was hoping this lesson would show me the most efficient ways to solve the challenges, but it ended up being just more practice for me. I will try to read more detailed articles on the subject in the future.

### Day 4: December 17, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Basic Algorithm Scripting lesson on freeCodeCamp. 

**Thoughts**: I learned about primitive values and how they are immutable. I also discovered that while practicing these challenges, sometimes it feels like I am not learning anything new. But they are helping me get better and faster at recognizing the subtle differences between all of the array and string methods, when to use them, and how to use them properly.

### Day 5: December 18, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Converted database on full-stack app from sqlite to mySQL.  

**Thoughts**: I learned how to create an issue and a new branch on my own repo in GitHub. I used youtube tutorials and articles to learn how to install mySQL and then convert the database on my full-stack app from sqlite to mySQL. Next I need to learn how to deploy to Heroku.

### Day 6: December 19, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Object Oriented Programming section on freeCodeCamp.  

**Thoughts**: I learned about prototype inheritance and the prototype chain. I also learned about mixins and how to use IIFEs to write them as a module. I have learned object oriented programming before, but this section clarified a lot of terms that used to make my eyes glaze over. I didn't feel like coding today after working so hard yesterday, but I'm glad I did because this was really helpful.

### Day 7: December 20, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Solved the Making Anagrams challenge on HackerRank  

**Thoughts**: My brain was feeling foggy, so learning new things wasn't an option. I settled for solving an 'easy' HackerRank. It took me way longer than expected to solve it but I finally did it, and as always, I learned from it.

### Day 8: December 21, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Solved two string manipulation challenges on HackerRank  

**Thoughts**: I solved the easy challenge immediately, but the medium challenge took me a while and my code got kind of long, but at least I solved it. I got another start on my problem solving badge.

### Day 9: December 22, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Prepared my full-stack app for deployment  

**Thoughts**: I reorganized and edited my app to prepare it for deployment. I got stuck trying to figure out the database part of it. I will work on that next time.
